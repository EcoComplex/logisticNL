Macroalgae ODD
1. Purpose and patterns
What system are we modeling? Macroalgae dynamics in coastal Antarctic ecosystems.  
What are we trying to learn about it? What happens with the dynamics under different conditions of temperature, ice coverage and sediments concentration. 
What problem the model is to solve? How the macroalgae biomass is affected by climate change. 
Purpose: model macroalgae dynamics under three different variables, so as to know how climate change may affect it. 
Patterns: abundance and diversity are expected to be inversely proportional to melting disturbances; a decline in ice coverage leads to free substratum for colonization, improving growth; melting process increases the suspended soils concentration and declines light incidence, leading to a loss of biomass. 

2. Entities, state variables and scales
Entities
Agents: species of macroalgae.
Environment: square patches of substratum.
Global environment: temperature, ice coverage, sediments concentration, light incidence / development state, growth rate, death rate.
State variables
Agents: size, location (coordinates), biomass. 
Environment: type, size (when is real, 25x25 m2) slope, length, location. 
Scales
Temporal:  days. 
Spacial: specify spatial resolution because we are representing variation over space. 

3. Process overview and scheduling 
Macroalgae: feed, grow/serve as food, reproduce, die. 
Substratum: availability. 

4. Design concepts
a. Basic principles: 1. ice coverage variability has no effect on the amount of biomass; a decline in ice coverage leads to free substratum for colonization, improving growth; melting process increases the suspended soils concentration and declines light incidence, leading to a loss of biomass; the total effect of the climate change on the biomass would be positive. Biomass equation / It is known that macroalgae develop on rocky substratum and that dynamics modeling is almost inexistent because access and sampling on the field are difficult. / 2. Principles incorporated as entities and state variables. / Principles implemented. 
b. Emergence: 3. What happens with the dynamics under different conditions of temperature, ice coverage and sediments concentration. 
c. Adaptation: 4. feed, grow/serve as food, reproduce, die. / If there is light and substratum: feed, grow, reproduce. Serve as food, die. / 5. Agents choose among alternatives in the conditions, there is no real life evidence. 
d. Objectives: 6. amount of biomass. / Predict changes in the dynamics. 
e. Learning: no 
f. Prediction: no, because no learning. 
g. Sensing: 11. substratum and global environment. / Methodology assumptions. 12. All must be modeled explicitly. 13. Accuracy / space. 
h. Interaction: 14. With each other? Competition for resources. /  16. Real interactions?
i. Stochasticy: 17. Not included in dynamics, maybe the result. Global environment?
j. Collectives: 18. Are there? 19. How?
k. Observation: 20. Biomass, rates, availability of all the different resources. 21. Abundance, diversity and biomass. / changes in the biomass: increase or decline. 

5. Initialization: 
Number of algae and its location, 
the initial values of all the state variables. 

6. Input data
Real data of global environment. 

7. Submodels
Feed: if there is substratum and light incidence  
Grow/serve as food: if there is substratum and light incidence / increase or decline of energy 
Reproduce: if there is substratum and light incidence / decline of energy / biomass increase
Die: decline of energy / free substratum 

Availability: if free, start growing / if busy, die.

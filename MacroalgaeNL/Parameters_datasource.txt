Parameters to be used in the model

Growth rate:

Net photosynthetic rates (Pmax) were high in the brown alga Desmarestia anceps and 
the red algae Palmaria decipiens with values close to 33 and 36 umol O2 g-1 h-1, 
respectively, at 20 m depth.

Propagule release and settlement:


Graze rate:

Grazing is probably the most important biotic factor controlling the structure andcomposition of seaweed-dominated communities. In Antarctic benthic systems, theearly successional stages dominated by small-sized seaweeds and periphyton representexcellent models to study how grazing modifies different ecological propertiesnot only of native assemblages but also of alien species, whose arrival and establishmentwill be stimulated by climate warming.

---##ODD PROTOCOL FOR ANTARCTIC MACROALGAE MODEL##---

ELEMENTS OF THE ODD PROTOCOL

#OVERVIEW

1. Purpose and patterns

	The purpose of this model is to study the dynamics of Antarctic macroalgae taking into account a typical coastal Antarctic habitat. 
	We will consider Potter Cove (South Shetland Islands) as a case study.
	The principal pattern that rules such dynamics are the effects of climate change on the temporal and spatial scales: 
	temperature, ice coverage and sediment load.
	Abundance and diversity are expected to be inversely proportional to glacier melting disturbances; 
	a decline in ice coverage leads to free substratum for colonization, increasing growth; melting process increases suspended sediment concentration and reduces
	light incidence, leading to a loss of biomass. 
	In particular, our research question is: what is the effect of climate change (temperature rising, reduction in sea ice cover and 
	increment of sediment input) on macroalgae biomass?
	
		###Goals

        b. Evaluate the effect of inter-annual variability in ice cover on the primary production/biomass of
            macroalgae.
        c. Study the effect of the decrease in ice cover on the primary production of the
            macroalgae related to the increase in the area available for colonization.
        d. Evaluate the effects of less light due to sediment from melting of the
            glacier as a consequence of global warming.
        e. Evaluate global change scenarios and estimate possible impacts on Antarctic macroalgae.

2. Entities, state variables and scales

	The model has two kind of entities: macroalgae (agents) and patches representing habitat and its characteristics (availability, hardness, temperature, ice coverage, sediment concentration, light incidence).
	We also implemented two breeds of agents: one for annual macroalgae species and another for perennial macroalgae species.
	The environment also has its characteristics: type, size, slope, length, location.
	The temporal scale is yearly, and every time-step in the model will represent the summer season, when biomass data is collected.
	The spatial scale when is real is a defined dimension and when its virtual, 25x25 will be the resolution that we will work on.

3. Process overview and scheduling

	The main state variable is biomass; the processes that have incidence in that state variable are temperature, light, growth rate, mortality and biomass 
	from the previous year (if agents are representing the perennial breed).
	The agents (macroalgae) will have the following behaviour: grow, reproduce and die from grazing, ice breakage or because they completed their cycle (annuals). 
	The main characteristic of the patches (habitat) will be: availability, hardness, temperature, ice coverage, sediment concentration, light incidence.

## 4. Desing concepts


	+Basic principles
	
				B(t + 1) = B(t) + μmax Λ(t) Γ(t) B(t) - D(t) B(t) - M(t)

            B(t) = macroalgae biomass at time t;
            μmax = the maximum intrinsic growth rate;
            Λ(t); Γ(t) = effects of light and temperature on growth (respectively);
	    D(t); M(t) = biomass-dependent mortality rates associated with grazing and ice erosion (respectively).

        ** The only assumption that the model has is that nutrients are not limitant and that light, 
		temperature and ice disturbance should be considered as the main environmental variables.
		
		**To consider availability of patches we will establish a threshold to limit the amount of agents per patch. If there are more agents,
		competition effects for resources will be considered.

        ##Hypotheses:

        a. The greater inter-annual variability in ice cover does not produce a significant effect on the
            primary productivity.

        b. In some areas the effect of decreased ice cover has a positive influence on the
            primary production. This change produces an increase in the growth period of the
            macroalgae and in the area available for colonization.

        c. In some areas the effect of global warming produces a lower primary production 
	    as the melting of ice causes an increase in suspended sediments
            affecting light availability for macroalgae.

        d. The total effect of climate change on the net primary production / biomass of macroalgae
            will be positive.
			
		##Predictions:
	
     	P1. Macroalgae biomass will increase due to the newly ice-free areas with an expansion in the distribution of the community
		and a dominance of an autotrophic food web in the ecosystem.
		 
	P2. The macroalgae biomass will decrease due to ice scouring and its direct effect on the community and the increase of suspendended
		 sediments in the water column, increasing turbity. Turbidity can also have an effect on the overlapping the vertical distribution of the macroalgae,
		 producing competition (BUT let's remember that in this model we are not considering the effects of competition over biomass production).
			
	+Emergence:
	
		The most important output of the model will be the change in biomass over time due to the climate change effects
		Different scenarios under different conditions of temperature, ice coverage and sediment concentration. 
	
	+Adaptation: 
	
		The way agents respond to the changes in the environment will be reflected in the biomass produced at t+1. If the conditions of the environment (substratum availability, temperature, etc)
		are beneficial, it should be reflected in the biomass at t+1.

	+Objectives
	
		The agents don't have an adaptative behaviour.
	
	+ Learning
	
		The agents don't have the capacity to learn because they are macroalgae.
	
	+ Prediction
		
		In this model agents don't predict future conditions, they can only react to the present one and show its response at t+1.

    +Interaction
	
		We will not consider competition between agents in this model. We will establish a threshold of agents per patch to avoid the effects of competition
		on growth and reproduction.

    +Stochasticity
		
		We may introduce stochasticity in this model by including some abnormal years (ticks) in the form of a periodic function.

    +Collectives
		
		There is no collective behaviour in this type of agents.
		
    +Observation
	
		The main output of the model is macroalgae biomass.
	
5. Initialization
	
	The initial values of all the state variables: Macroalgae biomass samplings data
	Growth rate obtained bibliographically from previous studies.	
	If we aim to do a general model we can implement a range for temperature in a slider form and fix a starting point for that variable	
	
6. Input data
	
	Data files that are read while the model is executed.

	Enviromental data:
		- Water temperature;
		- Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR);
		- Sea icea extention and duration;
		- Meteorological variables, air temperature, wind and precipitation.
		
7. Submodels
	
	Initially, we propose a submodel for every term in the model equation:
				
		Submodel 1 -> Term for starting biomass (biomass from the previous year);
					For annual type agents, this term will be zero. 
					For perennial agents we will consider the biomass at t-1.
									
		Submodel 2 -> Term for growth of macroalgae; μmax Λ(t) Γ(t) B(t): The growth will depend on the growth rate, light availability and temperature
				
		Submodel 3 -> Term for mortality of macroalgae; the mortality will depend on grazing, ice scouring or natural death (life cycle completed). 
				
		Submodel 4 -> Model for reproduction and propagule dispersion.
